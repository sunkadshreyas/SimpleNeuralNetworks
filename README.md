Neural Network implementations in TensorFlow : 
<br /><br />
1) Fashion MNIST Dataset : <br />
Classify images of clothing. There are 10 types of clothing items.<br />
Training data consists of 60,000 images (grayscale).<br />
CNN is also implemented for the same task. <br />
CNN architecture : Two layers of Conv2D and Max Pooling followed by Fully Connected Layer and Softmax Layer.<br />
